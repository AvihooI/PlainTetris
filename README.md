# PlainTetris
A simple tetris game made in a weekend with C#.NET and GDI+, showing that GDI+ is somewhat adequare for simple 2D games and is pretty easy to use in conjuction with a canvas form and Application.DoEvents() kind of game loop.

Controls:
The regular left, right, down for movement.
Up to rotate the piece (where applicable).
Space to shower the tetris piece down.
Enter to pause/unpause a game, as well as to start a new game after a game over.
Escape to close the game.
